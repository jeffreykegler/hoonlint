<h1 id="about-this-document">About this document</h1>
<p>This document is intended to describe the use of whitespace by Hoon to the level and to the degree of precision necessary for <code>hoonfmt</code> and <code>hoonlint</code>.</p>
<p>This document therefore only deals with conventions for Hoon expressions which contain gaps. These are</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tall Hoon expressions; and</p></li>
<li><p>SELGAP, a special case.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Whitespace in other Hoon expressions is always an &quot;ace&quot; -- a single space. For these Hoon expressions in which all whitespace is an ace, there is no latitude in the use of whitespace, and no need for conventions of the kind described in this document.</p>
<h1 id="terminology">Terminology</h1>
<h2 id="deontology">Deontology</h2>
<p>In this document, we say &quot;<code>X</code> should be <code>Y</code>&quot;, if <code>X</code> must be <code>Y</code>, in order to meet the standard described in this document. Code, or practices which do not meet this standard we will call <strong>non-standard</strong>. One pragmatic consequence of non-standard code is that it may draw warnings from <code>hoonlint</code>. It is expected that, even in carefully written Hoon code, non-standard practices will occur.</p>
<p>In this document, we say &quot;<code>X</code> must be <code>Y</code>&quot;, if <code>X</code> must be <code>Y</code> in both standard and non-standard code. This would be the case, for example, if X is Y as matter of definition, or due to a mathematical equivalence.</p>
<h2 id="lines-columns-and-indentation">Lines, columns and indentation</h2>
<p>This document applies to Hoon source files. A Hoon source file is organized in newline-terminated lines each of which contains 1 or more characters. The 1-based offset of a character in its line is its <strong>column location</strong>. The 1-based line number of a character is its <strong>line location</strong>. Line location is often abbreviated to <strong>line</strong>, and column location is often abbreviated to <strong>column</strong>.</p>
<p>To avoid confusion, in this document column position is always used to mean the location of a character within a line, as defined above. When we discuss other horizontal vs. vertical grids, we use the terms &quot;row&quot; for position on the vertical axis, and &quot;silo&quot; for position on the horizontal axis. The definition of the specific meaning of &quot;row&quot; and &quot;silo&quot; will be given with the context where it is used.</p>
<p>The column location at which <code>x</code> starts will sometimes be written as <code>Column(x)</code>, where <code>x</code> designates some text in a Hoon source file. The line location at which <code>x</code> starts will sometimes be written as <code>Line(x)</code>. When we say &quot;the column location of <code>x</code>&quot;, we mean <code>Column(x)</code>.</p>
<p>A <strong>stop</strong> is two spaces. We say the text <code>Y</code> is indented <code>N</code> stops <strong>after</strong> text <code>X</code>, if there are exactly <code>N</code> stops between the end of text <code>X</code> and the beginning of text <code>Y</code>.</p>
<p>If the column location of text <code>X</code> is <code>N</code> stops more than the column location of text <code>Y</code>, then text <code>X</code> begins at column <code>Column(Y)+N*2</code>. If the column location of text <code>X</code> is <code>N</code> stops less than the column location of text <code>Y</code>, then text <code>X</code> begins at column <code>Column(Y)-N*2</code>.</p>
<p>A <strong>brick</strong> is a subtree of the Hoon syntax tree with semantics. A subtree without semantics is a <strong>mortar</strong> subtree. All rune expressions are bricks, but not all bricks are rune expressions. Mortar subtrees will not play a big role in this document -- they are usually invisible at the source file level.</p>
<p>Many alignments are with respect to an <strong>anchor column</strong>. Often, the anchor column is the rune column, but there are important exceptions, which will be described below.</p>
<h2 id="hoon-expressions">Hoon expressions</h2>
<p>A tall <strong>rune-ish expression</strong> is a tall hoon expression whose &quot;keyword&quot; is a rune-ish. A <code>rune-ish</code> is usually a rune, but the <code>rune-ishes</code> also include some other keyword digraphs, such as <code>++</code>, <code>+=</code>, <code>+-</code>, <code>--</code> and <code>==</code>. Currently rune-ishes are always represented in Hoon source files as digraphs.</p>
<p>Digraphs which introduce comments, such as <code>::</code> are <strong>not</strong> considered rune-ishes. Comments, including the digraphs which begin them are considered whitespace, and nothing in whitespace is considered a rune-ish.</p>
<p>Let <code>r</code> be the rune-ish digraph of a rune-ish expression. The <strong>rune line</strong> of a hoon is <code>Line(r)</code>. The <strong>rune column</strong> of a hoon is <code>Column(r)</code>.</p>
<p>A rune-ish expression consists of the initial rune-ish followed by zero or more subexpressions, called <strong>runechildren</strong>. The <strong>arity</strong> of a rune-ish expression is the number of its runechildren. In the hoon expressions being considered in this document, runechildren are separated from the initial rune-ish, and from each other, by gaps.</p>
<p>Let <code>r</code> be a rune-ish. We sometimes write the hoon expression that begin with <code>r</code> as <code>Hoon(r)</code>. If <code>h</code> is a Hoon, we can write its rune-ish as <code>Rune(h)</code>. Then</p>
<pre><code>   Line(Hoon(r)) == Line(r)
   Column(Hoon(r)) == Column(r)</code></pre>
<p>Let <code>h</code> be a rune-ish expression. We sometimes write the hoon expression that is the syntactic parent of <code>h</code> as <code>Parent(h)</code>.</p>
<h2 id="horizontal-alignment">Horizontal Alignment</h2>
<p>All non-whitespace lexemes in Hoon are aligned horizontally in one of 4 ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Tight</strong>: Tightly aligned non-whitespace lexemes follow the preceding non-whitespace lexeme by exactly one stop. A non-whitespace lexeme cannot be tightly aligned if it is the first non-whitespace lexeme on its line.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Backdented</strong>: Hoon's standard alignment, described in detail below.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inter-line</strong>: Inter-line alignment aligns the non-whitespace lexeme with non-whitespace lexemes on associated lines. Which non-whitespace lexeme is aligned with which, and which lines are considered &quot;associated&quot; varies depending on the syntactic context. Inter-line alignment is described in detail in the sections describing the syntaxes where it is allowed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Free-form</strong>: Within SELGAP hoons, horizontal alignment in standard code can be free-form.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pseudo-joins">Pseudo-joins</h2>
<p>In many cases, these conventions distinguish between &quot;joined&quot; and &quot;split&quot; syntax, so that whether the gap between two texts is vertical or horizontal affects other conventions. In the cases, it is sometimes convenient to have a gap which contains one or more comments but which, for the purposes of these conventions, behaves like a horizontal gap. Such a gap is called a <strong>pseudo-join</strong>.</p>
<p>Let <code>J</code> be a <strong>join column</strong>. A text is <strong>pseudo-joined</strong> at <code>J</code> if and every line of it, except the last line, has a comment at <code>J</code>. Note that this implies that the first, partial, line of the gap must contain a comment starting at <code>J</code>.</p>
<p>Intuitively, a pseudo-joins acts as a kind of &quot;place holder&quot; for the text that follows that the pseudo-join, and a pseudo-join comments can be seen as &quot;postponing&quot; the join.</p>
<p>Intuitively, a pseudo-join is equivalent to a horizontal gap if both of them position the text which follows them at the same column location. More formally, a pseudo-join is <strong>equivalent</strong> to a horizontal gap, if the join column of the pseudo-join is the column location immediately after the last character of the horizontal gap.</p>
<h2 id="reanchoring">Reanchoring</h2>
<p>Reanchoring is a method of conserving indentation. Typically, a rune-ish is its own &quot;anchor&quot; rune-ish for indentation purposes, but Hoon takes advantage of some opportunities to move the anchor column closer to the left margin. Not all rune-ishes participate in reanchoring. Which do, and which do not, is described in the individual cases.</p>
<p>We now present a more formal definition of reanchoring, which will be followed by a number of examples. Let <code>r</code> be a rune-ish. If <code>Line(r)</code> contains other rune-ishes, <code>r</code> may <strong>reanchor</strong>, that is, the anchor column of <code>r</code> may be somewhere to the left of <code>Column(r)</code>.</p>
<p>For every rune-ish, there is always an anchor rune-ish, although usually this is trivially true -- a rune-ish is its own anchor rune-ish. Let <code>a</code> be an anchor rune-ish. The anchor column is the column of an anchor rune-ish, plus the <strong>reanchor-offset</strong>.</p>
<p>Again, let <code>r</code> Let <code>S</code> be a sequence of rune-ishes such that</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>S</code> is empty if a rune-ish is its own anchor, that is <code>S</code> is empty if <code>a == r</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>S[0] = a</code></p></li>
<li><p>Where <code>S[n]</code> is the last element of <code>S</code>, <code>S[n] = (Rune(Parent(Hoon(r)))</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>For all <code>i</code> such that <code>0 &lt;= i &lt; n</code>, S[i] = (Rune(Parent(Hoon(S[i+1])))`</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that, by the above definition, <code>r</code> is never an element of <code>S</code>. Informally, if <code>S</code> is not empty, it includes <code>a</code> and all the proper syntactic parents of <code>r</code> which are descendants of <code>a</code>.</p>
<p>Intuitively, the per-rune-ish offsets are the indentation that is &quot;left over&quot; when its rune-ish child begins. Note that, because of the way that we constructed <code>S</code>, the <code>c</code>'th runechild of <code>S[i]</code> must be a rune-ish. More formally, let <code>S[i]</code> be a rune-ish in S, and let <code>c</code> be the number of runechildren of <code>S[i]</code> that are on <code>Line(S[i])</code>. The per-rune-ish offset is the indentation from the anchor column that would apply to the <code>c</code>'th runechild if it were on <code>Line(S[i]) + 1</code>.</p>
<p>The <strong>reanchor offset</strong> of <code>r</code> is the sum of all the per-rune-ish offsets in <code>S</code>. Note that in the trivial case, where a rune-ish is its own anchor, <code>S</code> is always empty; the reanchor offset is always zero; and the anchor column is always the same as the rune column.</p>
<h3 id="first-example">First example</h3>
<p><em>From <code>arvo/sys/vane/ford.hoon</code>, lines 1916-1920:</em></p>
<pre><code>        :+  %depends  %|  :~
          definitions+[%&amp; deh]
          listeners+[%&amp; sup]
          waiting+[%&amp; out]
        ==</code></pre>
<p>The rune line is line 1916, and the rune is COLSIG (<code>:~</code>). The anchor rune-ish is the COLLUS (<code>:+</code>). COLLUS is 3-fixed, but all three of its runechildren are on the rune line, so the per-rune-ish offset is 0. The anchor column is the anchor rune-ish column plus the reanchor offset, so that in this case, the anchor column is the same as the anchor rune-ish column.</p>
<p>COLSIG is 0-running, and normal COLSIG indentation indents the runsteps one stop past the anchor column, and puts the final TISTIS at the anchor column. This is exactly what we see.</p>
<h3 id="second-example">Second example</h3>
<p><em>From <code>arvo/lib/hood/kiln.hoon</code>, lines 346-356:</em></p>
<pre><code>    =/  request-data  :~
        [0 [0 8.080] 0 &#39;localhost&#39; ~]
        ::  associate 0 as the anonymous ship, which is the ++add result.
        [[0 (scot %p (add our ^~((bex 64))))] ~ ~]
        &#39;not-yet-implemented&#39;
        `&#39;en-US,en;q=0.9&#39;
        `.127.0.0.1
      ==
    =/  monies/coin  [%many ~[[%blob request-data] [%$ ~.n 0]]]
    =/  request/silk:ford  [%bake %urb monies [our %home [%da now]] /web]
    (emit `card`[%exec /kiln/prime/cache our `[[our %home [%da now]] request]])</code></pre>
<p>Here the rune line is line 346, the rune-ish is again COLSIG, and it reanchors at TISFAS (<code>=/</code>). TISFAS is 3-fixed, and 2 of its runechildren are on the rune line, so that the per-rune-ish offset of the TISFAS is that of its 2nd runechild -- one stop. The anchor column is therefore one stop after the anchor rune-ish column.</p>
<p>COLSIG again is 0-running, so that its runsteps should be indented one stop past the anchor column. By the same logic, the TISTIS should be indented at the anchor column. This is what we see in the example. The last three lines of the example are the last runechild of the TISFAS.</p>
<h2 id="header-and-inline-comments">Header and inline comments</h2>
<p>Comments count as whitespace. A comment is a <strong>header comment</strong> if it is on a line by itself. If a comment is not a header comment, it is a <strong>rightside</strong> comment. A rightside comment is a <strong>margin comment</strong> if it begins at or after column 57, or immediately after a horizontal gap of 20 or more spaces. All margin comments should start at column 57. A rightside comment is an <strong>inline comment</strong> if it is not a margin comment.</p>
<p>In standard code, header comments are</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pre-comments or inter-comments, as determined by their hoon.</p></li>
<li><p>Meta-comments.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We say a hoon is the hoon of a comment if that hoon directly contains the gap that that comment is part of. A comment is &quot;directly contained&quot; by a hoon if the hoon contains the comment, but no proper subexpression of the hoon also contains that comment. This implies that a vertical gap, and its comments, are &quot;contained&quot; by a rune-ish expression if that vertical gap separates the rune-ish from the first runechild; or if that vertical gap separates a consecutive pair of the rune-ish expression's runechildren.</p>
<p>Meta-comments start at column 1. Since, depending on their hoon, inter-comments may also start at column 1, only the programmer's intent determines whether a given header comment is an inter-comment or a meta-comment. An inter-comment is structural, so that its content should fit the syntactic structure of the code in which it occurs. Meta-comments are not structural comments, and their content may be anything. A frequent use for meta-comments is to &quot;comment out&quot; Hoon code.</p>
<h2 id="staircase-comments">Staircase comments</h2>
<p>Informally, staircase comments take the form</p>
<pre><code>::
::
::::
  ::
  ::</code></pre>
<p>More formally, a staircase comment consists of an <strong>upper riser</strong>, a <strong>tread</strong>, and a <strong>lower riser</strong>. The upper riser is a sequence of normal comment lines, aligned at the anchor column. The tread is four colons, aligned at the anchor column and followed by a whitespace character. The lower riser is a sequence of normal comment lines, aligned at the column one stop greater than the anchor column. A more formal definition of a staircase is given in an appendix.</p>
<h2 id="vertical-gaps">Vertical Gaps</h2>
<p>A <strong>vertical gap</strong> is a gap which contains</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A newline-terminated partial line preamble. This preamble may be of length 1 -- that is, it may be just the newline.</p></li>
<li><p>A body of one or more full newline-terminated lines, all of them header comments or (in the case of non-standard code) blank lines.</p></li>
<li><p>A partial line postamble. This is never newline-terminated, and may be zero-length.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A vertical gap may contain zero or more <strong>inter-comments</strong> followed by zero or more <strong>pre-comments</strong>. Both inter-comments and pre-comments can contain any content, but in concept, inter-comments separate the sequence steps from other lexemes, and from each other; while pre-comments preceed sequence steps.</p>
<p>Informally, the body of a standard vertical gap follows these conventions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A vertical gap may contain an &quot;inter-part&quot;, a &quot;pre-part&quot;, or both.</p></li>
<li><p>If both an inter-part and a pre-part are present, the inter-part must precede the pre-part.</p></li>
<li><p>The inter-part is a non-empty sequence of inter-comments and staircases.</p></li>
<li><p>A pre-part is a non-empty sequence of pre-comments.</p></li>
<li><p>Meta-comments may be inserted anywhere in either the pre-part or the inter-part.</p></li>
<li><p>Comments which do not obey the above rules are <strong>bad comments</strong>. A <strong>good comment</strong> is any comment which is not a bad comment.</p></li>
<li><p>A comment is not regarded as a meta-comment if it can be parsed as structural comment. An <strong>structural comment</strong> is any good comment which is not a meta-comment.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A more formal description of a vertical gap body is given in an appendix.</p>
<h1 id="types-of-hoons">Types of hoons</h1>
<p>Every hoon falls into one of 5 disjoint classes: backdented, running, jogging, battery or irregular.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A hoon is a <strong>battery hoon</strong> if it contains an runechild that uses the battery syntax.</p></li>
<li><p>A hoon is a <strong>running hoon</strong> if it contains an runechild that uses the running syntax.</p></li>
<li><p>A hoon is a <strong>jogging hoon</strong> if it contains an runechild that uses the jogging syntax.</p></li>
<li><p>A hoon is a <strong>backdented hoon</strong> if it contains a fixed number of gap-separated runechildren, and none of them follow the running, jogging or battery syntax.</p></li>
<li><p>A hoon is an <strong>irregular hoon</strong> if it is not a backdented, running, jogging or backdented hoon. Most irregular hoons do not contain a gap.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="fixed-arity-hoons">Fixed arity hoons</h1>
<p>The flagship Hoon whitespace strategy is backdenting. Variations on the idea of backdenting appear throughout, but the archetypal case of backdenting is its use in fixed arity hoons. Here is a example of a backdented 4-ary hoon:</p>
<p><em>From <code>arvo/sys/hoon.hoon</code>, 6752-6755:</em></p>
<pre><code>        :^    %wtcl
            [%dtts [%rock %$ |] [%$ axe]]
          [%rock %f |]
        [%rock %f &amp;]
</code></pre>
<p>A backdented hoon of arity 3 or more should be joined. A backdented hoon of arity 2 or less should be split.</p>
<p>The first runechild of a joined backdented hoon should be on the same line as the rune, separated by a gap. Subsequent runechildren of a joined backdented hoon should be separated by a vertical gap.</p>
<p>The first runechild of a joined backdented hoon should be separated from the rune by a vertical gap. Subsequent runechildren of a joined backdented hoon should also be separated by a vertical gap.</p>
<p>In an fixed <code>n</code>-arity hoon, the <code>m</code>'th runechild should be indented <code>n-m</code> stops more than the anchor column. For example, in an 3-runechild hoon, the first runechild should be indented 2 stops more than the anchor column; a second runechild should be indented 1 stop more than the anchor column; and the third runechild be indented at the anchor column.</p>
<p>This implies that, regardless of the number of runechildren in a backdented hoon,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the last runechild should be aligned at the anchor column;</p></li>
<li><p>every runechild before the last should have a column location one stop greater than the column location of the runechild that follows it.</p></li>
<li><p>every runechild after the first should have a column location one stop less than the runechild that precedes it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the vertical gaps belonging to backdented hoons, the inter-comment column location should be the column location of the first text after the gap; and the pre-comment column location should be undefined.</p>
<h2 id="chaining-fixed-arity-hoons">Chaining fixed arity hoons</h2>
<p>As a special case, a runechild of an backdented hoon may have an inter-line alignment, based on its <strong>silo</strong> and <strong>chain</strong>.</p>
<p><em>From <code>arvo/sys/zuse.hoon</code>, lines 2950-2959:</em></p>
<pre><code>     ::
     ::  make acru cores
     ::
     =/  ali      (pit:nu:crub 512 (shaz &#39;Alice&#39;))
     =/  ali-pub  (com:nu:crub pub:ex.ali)
     =/  bob      (pit:nu:crub 512 (shaz &#39;Robert&#39;))
     =/  bob-pub  (com:nu:crub pub:ex.bob)
     ::
     ::  alice signs and encrypts a symmetric key to bob
     ::</code></pre>
<p>Intuitively, if two runchildren are in the same silo of the same chain, they should have the same inter-line alignment.</p>
<p>More formally, a chain is a sequence of fixed-arity hoons which obeys the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Every hoon except the first is the last runchild of the previous hoon in the sequence</p></li>
<li><p>Every tall rune-ish is either</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a &quot;row-initial&quot; tall rune-ish, which should be at the same column location as the first hoon in the sequence, or;</p></li>
<li><p>a &quot;joined&quot; tall rune-ish, that is, another tall rune-ish on the same line as the initial rune-ish.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The sequence is maximal. That is, no chain is a sub-sequence of a longer chain.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the purposes of chain inter-line alignment, a row starts with a row-initial rune-ish. The silo elements for a row are its tall rune-ishes and their runechildren, in lexical order, recursively. A runechild which itself is a tall rune-ish expressions is never a silo elements -- instead it is broken out into its rune-ish and runechildren, and these are become silo elements in that row. Each silo element goes into one silo, so that the first silo element goes into silo 0, the second goes into silo 1, etc.</p>
<p>A row may contain multiple lines, but rune-ishes and runechildren not on the first line of the row are not used in determining inter-line alignment, and therefore are not added as silo elements.</p>
<p>This implies that</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Every row-initial rune-ish is in silo 0,</p></li>
<li><p>Every tall rune-ish is a separate silo element.</p></li>
<li><p>Every runechildren of a tall rune-ish is a separate silo element, unless it is itself a tall rune-ish.</p></li>
<li><p>For chained inter-line alignment, The row and silo grid may be &quot;ragged&quot;, so that some rows do not have elements in every silo.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the following example, there are 4 rows each of 3 silos. Every row in a chain starts with a rune-ish, but not every rune-ish need start a row, and a given silo may contain both rune-ishes and runechildren.</p>

<p>In the above example, the chain contains 3 rows. (The 3rd and 4th lines are both in last row.) There are 3 silos, but the rows are &quot;ragged&quot;, so that nothing in the first row is in the 3rd silo. In all 3 rows, the 2nd silo is tightly aligned, as is the 3rd silo in the 2nd row.</p>
<p>The 3rd silo of the 3rd row is inter-line aligned. The <code>b</code> in the 3rd row comes after a gap of 3 spaces, but this follows the standard set forth in this document because it aligns with the <code>b</code> of the 2nd row, at column location 13.</p>
<p>Note that the 2nd silo includes both runechild and a rune-ish. This is an example of a &quot;joined&quot; hoon. In a chained hoon sequence, when the row starts with a unary rune, joined hoons can be convenient.</p>

<h1 id="jogging-hoons">Jogging hoons</h1>
<p>A jogging runechild is more often called simply a <strong>jogging</strong>. (Currently all hoons contains at most one jogging.)</p>
<p>In addition to the jogging, a jogging hoon may contain other runechildren, either before or after the jogging. An runechild after the jogging is called a <strong>tail</strong>. If there is one runechild before the jogging, it is called the <strong>head</strong> of the jogging hoon. If there are two runechildren before the jogging, they are called, in order, the <strong>head</strong> and <strong>subhead</strong> of the jogging.</p>
<p>There are current three kinds of jogging.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The current 1-jogging rules are CENTIS (<code>%=</code>), CENCAB (<code>%_</code>) and WUTHEP (<code>?-</code>). A 1-jogging has one head and no tail.</p></li>
<li><p>The current 2-jogging rules are CENTAR (<code>%*</code>) and WUTLUS (<code>?+</code>). A 2-jogging has a head and a subhead and no tail.</p></li>
<li><p>The current jogging-1 rule is TISCOL (<code>=:</code>). A jogging-1 has a tail and no head.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A jogging is a gap-separated sequence of one or more jogs. Every <strong>jog</strong> contains a <strong>jog head</strong>, followed by a gap and a <strong>jog body</strong>. Note that it is important to distinguish between the head of a jogging hoon, defined above, and the head of a jog.</p>
<h2 id="chess-sidedness">Chess-sidedness</h2>
<p>Jogs, joggings and jogging hoons have <strong>chess-sidedness</strong>. Chess-sidedness is always either kingside and queenside.</p>
<p>Informally, <strong>kingside</strong> means the indentation has a left-side bias; and <strong>queenside</strong> means that the indentation has a right-side bias. Indentation will be described more precisely in what follows.</p>
<h2 id="jogs">Jogs</h2>
<p>The indentation of a jog is that of its head. A jog is <strong>joined</strong> if its head is on the same line as its body. Otherwise, a jog is <strong>multiline</strong>. As explained below, a multiline jog may be either <strong>pseudo-joined</strong> or <strong>split</strong>.</p>
<p>Jogs are either kingside or queenside. In standard code, the sidedness of a jog determines the alignment of split jogs.</p>
<p>The base column location of a jog depends on the jogging hoon that it belongs to. It is specified in the description for the different kinds of jogging hoon.</p>
<h3 id="joined-jogs">Joined jogs</h3>
<p>A joined jog may be either <strong>aligned</strong> or <strong>ragged</strong>. A joined jog is ragged if its body is indented 1 stop after its head. Otherwise, a joined jog is considered aligned.</p>
<p>All aligned jogs in a jogging should be indented to the same column. This column is called the <strong>jogging body column</strong> of the jogging. A jog body which is aligned at the jog body column is said to be <strong>jogging-body-aligned</strong>. A jog whose jog body is jogging-body-aligned is also said to be <strong>jogging-body-aligned</strong>.</p>
<p>The pseudo-join of pseudo-joined jog should be equivalent to the one of the horizontal gaps that a joined jog is allowed according to this standard.</p>
<h3 id="split-jogs">Split jogs</h3>
<p>The gap of split jog should be vertical. The inter-comment column location of the gap should be the column location of the jog body; and there should be no pre-comment column location. The standard column location of the body of a split job varies according to the sidedness of the jog.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The column location of the body of a split kingside jog should be 1 stop <strong>greater</strong> than the column location of the jog's head.</p></li>
<li><p>The column location of the body of a split queenside jog should be 1 stop <strong>less</strong> than the column location of the jog's head.</p></li>

<p>Whitespace in one-line SELGAP's is free-form -- <code>hoonlint</code> never generates a warning for them.</p>
<p>Only one-line SELGAP's occur in the <code>arvo</code> corpus. If <code>hoonlint</code> encounters a multi-line SELGAP, it issues a &quot;not yet implemented&quot; warning.</p>
<h1 id="appendix-non-standard-code">Appendix: Non-standard code</h1>
<p>In non-standard code -- code which does not follow these guidelines, <code>hoonlint</code> sometimes must decide the &quot;intended&quot; syntax, in order to produce diagnostics that are as helpful as possible. This section describes the methods used for deciding what was &quot;intended&quot; in non-standard Hoon code.</p>
<h2 id="chess-sidedness-1">Chess-sidedness</h2>
<p>A jog is considered queenside if its indentation is 2 stops or more greater than the anchor column. Otherwise, the jog is considered kingside.</p>
<p>The chess-sidedness of a misindented jogging is that of the majority of its jogs. In case of a tie, the jogging is considered to be queenside. The chess-sidedness of a misindented jogging hoon is that of its jogging.</p>
<h2 id="jogging-body-column">Jogging body column</h2>
<p>In non-standard code, the jogging body column of a jogging is considered to be the most common start column of the bodies of the jogging's aligned jogs. If more than one column is &quot;most common&quot;, so that there is a tie, the jogging body column is the body column of the lexically first jog to have its jog body start at one of the most common columns. If there are no aligned jogs in a jogging, the jogging body column is the body column of the lexically first jog in the jogging.</p>
<h2 id="inter-line-alignment">Inter-line alignment</h2>
<p>In non-standard code, the inter-line alignment of a column of lexemes is the alignment most common in the &quot;wide&quot; lexemes. (Wide lexemes are those which do not have tight or backdented alignment.)</p>
<p>If two alignments tie by wide lexeme count, the tie is broken using the total lexeme count. If two alignments tie by total lexeme count, the tie is broken in favor of the alignment which occurs first, lexically.</p>
<p>If there are no wide lexemes, the inter-line alignment is irrelevant and left undefined. Also, the inter-line alignment is undefined unless it has a total lexeme count of at least 2 -- in other words an inter-line alignment must actually align with a corresponding lexeme on another line.</p>
<h2 id="inter-line-alignment-by-silo">Inter-line alignment by silo</h2>
<p>In the case of chained inter-line alignments, runstep inter-line alignments, and running-inheritied inter-line alignments, multiple silos are involved. The rules multi-silo inter-line alignments in non-standard code are an extension of the basic rules for inter-line alignments in non-standard code. When only one silo is involved, the rules are equivalent.</p>
<p>Each silo is examined separately. For each silo, only rows with an element in that silo participate in the calculation.</p>
<p>For runstep alignment and running-inherited alignment, the &quot;wide&quot; elements at those which are not tightly aligned. For chains, the &quot;wide&quot; elements are those which are tightly or backdented aligned.</p>
<p>If a running could have both a runestep alignment, and a running-inherited alignment, the runestep alignment takes precedence. In other words, if a running has runestep alignment, the running-inherited alignment is undefined.</p>
<h1 id="appendix-vertical-gap-body">Appendix: Vertical gap body</h1>
<p>The format of a vertical gap body obeys the BNF</p>
<pre><code>:start ::= gapComments
gapComments ::= OptExceptions Body

Body ::= InterPart PrePart
Body ::= InterPart
Body ::= PrePart
InterPart ::= InterComponent
InterPart ::= InterruptedInterComponents
InterPart ::= InterruptedInterComponents InterComponent

InterruptedInterComponents ::= InterruptedInterComponent+
InterruptedInterComponent ::= InterComponent Exceptions

OptPreComponents ::= PreComponent*
PreComponent ::= ProperPreComponent
PreComponent ::= Exception

OptExceptions ::= Exception*
Exceptions ::= Exception+
Exception ::= MetaComment
Exception ::= BadComment
Exception ::= BlankLine</code></pre>
<p>The terminals in this BNF are</p>
<ul>
<li><p>BadComment -- a comment with any indent. Priority 3.</p></li>
<li><p>BlankLine -- a line terminated with a newline and otherwise containing only zero or more spaces. Priority 3.</p></li>
<li><p>InterComment -- a comment that starts at the inter-comment column. Priority 1.</p></li>
<li><p>LowerRiser -- a comment that starts one stop past the inter-comment column. Priority 1.</p></li>
<li><p>MetaComment -- a comment that starts at column zero. Priority 2.</p></li>
<li><p>PreComment -- a comment that starts at the pre-comment column. Priority 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Tread -- a comment that starts at the inter-comment column, whose first four characters are colons, and whose fifth character is either a space or a newline. Priority 1.</p></li>
<li><p>UpperRiser -- a comment that starts at the inter-comment column. Priority 1.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Terminals are ambiguous -- a given line may match more than one terminal. The lexer limits this ambiguity using the &quot;priorities&quot;. Comments are read as if tested for each priority in numerical order. This has the slightly counter-intuitive effect that the highest priority is the lowest numbered one. Comments with the same priority are treated as if tested all at once, which allows for ambiguous terminals.</p>
<p>Specifically,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No comment is read as a Priority 3 comment if it can be lexed as a Priority 1 or 2 comment.</p></li>
<li><p>No comment is read as a Priority 2 comment if it can be lexed as a Priority 1.</p></li>
</ul>
