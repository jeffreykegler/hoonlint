<h1 id="about-this-document">About this document</h1>
<p>This document is intended to describe the use of whitespace by Hoon to the level and degree of precision necessary for <code>hoonfmt</code> and <code>hoonlint</code>.</p>
<p>Whitespace in wide Hoon expressions and in all irregular expressions except SELACE, is always an &quot;ace&quot; -- a single space. This means that, for these Hoon expressions, there is latitude in the use of whitespace, and therefore no need for conventions of the kind described in this document.</p>
<p>This document therefore only deals with conventions for Hoon expressions which contain gaps. These are</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tall Hoon expressions; and</p></li>
<li><p>SELACE, a special case.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="terminology">Terminology</h1>
<h2 id="deontology">Deontology</h2>
<p>In this document, we say &quot;<code>X</code> should be <code>Y</code>&quot;, if <code>X</code> must be <code>Y</code>, in order to meet the standard described in this document. Code, or practices which do not meet this standard we will call <strong>non-standard</strong>. One pragmatic consequence of non-standard code is that, by default, it may draw warnings from the Hoon toolkit. It is expected that, even in carefully written Hoon code, non-standard practices will occur.</p>
<h2 id="lines-columns-and-indentation">Lines, columns and indentation</h2>
<p>In this document, a <strong>stop</strong> is two spaces. We say the text <code>Y</code> is indented <code>N</code> stops <strong>after</strong> text <code>X</code>, if there are exactly <code>N</code> stops between the end of text <code>X</code> and the beginning of text <code>Y</code>.</p>
<p>This document applies to Hoon source files. A Hoon source file is organized in newline-terminated lines each of which contains 1 or more characters. The 1-based offset of a character in its line is its <strong>column location</strong>. The 1-based line number of a character is its <strong>line location</strong>. Line location is often abbreviated to <strong>line</strong>, and column location is often abbreviated to <strong>column</strong>.</p>
<p>The column location at which <code>x</code> starts will sometimes be written as <code>Column(x)</code>, where <code>x</code> designates some text in a Hoon source file. The line location at which <code>x</code> starts will sometimes be written as <code>Line(x)</code>. When we say &quot;the column location of <code>x</code>&quot;, we mean <code>Column(x)</code>.</p>
<p>A <strong>stop</strong> is two spaces. If the column location of text <code>X</code> is <code>N</code> stops more than the column location of text <code>Y</code>, then text <code>X</code> begins at column <code>Column(Y)+N*2</code>. If the column location of text <code>X</code> is <code>N</code> stops less than the column location of text <code>Y</code>, then text <code>X</code> begins at column <code>Column(Y)-N*2</code>.</p>
<p>A <strong>brick</strong> is a subtree of the Hoon syntax tree with semantics. A subtree without semantics is a <strong>mortar</strong> subtree. All rune expressions are bricks, but not all bricks are rune expressions. Mortar subtrees will not play a big role in this document -- they are usually invisible at the source file level.</p>
<p>Many alignments are with respect to an <strong>anchor column</strong>. Often, the anchor column is the rune column, but there are important exceptions, which will be described below.</p>
<h2 id="hoon-expressions">Hoon expressions</h2>
<p>A tall <strong>rune-ish expression</strong> is a tall hoon expression whose &quot;keyword&quot; is a rune-ish. A <code>rune-ish</code> is usually a rune, but the <code>rune-ishes</code> also include some other keyword digraphs, such as <code>++</code>. (TODO: Give more detail re rune-ishes.) Currently rune-ishes are always represented in Hoon source files as digraphs. Let <code>r</code> be the rune-ish digraph of a rune-ish expression. The <strong>rune line</strong> of a hoon is <code>Line(r)</code>. The <strong>rune column</strong> of a hoon is <code>Column(r)</code>.</p>
<p>A rune-ish expression consists of the initial rune-ish followed by zero or more subexpressions, called <strong>runechildren</strong>. Runechildren are separated from the initial rune-ish, and from each other, by gaps.</p>
<p>The <strong>arity</strong> of a rune-ish expression is the number of its runechildren.</p>
<h2 id="horizontal-alignment">Horizontal Alignment</h2>
<p>All lexemes in Hoon are aligned horizontally in one of 4 ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Tight</strong>: Tightly aligned lexemes follow the preceding lexeme by exactly one stop. A lexeme cannot be tightly aligned if it is the first one on its line.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Backdented</strong>: Hoon's standard alignment, described in detail below.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inter-line</strong>: Inter-line alignment aligns the lexeme with lexemes on associated lines. Which lexeme is aligned with which, and which lines are considered &quot;associated&quot; varies depending on the syntactic context. Inter-line alignment is described in detail in the sections describing the syntaxes where it is allowed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Free-form</strong>: Within SELACE hoons, horizontal alignment can be free-form.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reanchoring">Reanchoring</h2>
<p>If the rune line contains other bricks, it may <strong>reanchor</strong>, that is the anchor column may be somewhere other than the rune column. Not all runes participate in reanchoring. Which do, and which do not, is described in the individual cases.</p>
<p>We will first give a definition of reanchoring. Because the definitions are difficult to follow without illustrations, they are followed by a number of examples.</p>
<p>Informally, reanchoring is a method of conserving indentation. Reanchoring moves the anchor column left on the rune line, so that it becomes based at a parent brick earlier in the rune line. The column of the parent brick becomes the <strong>anchor brick column</strong>. All parent bricks contribute to the backdenting, so that all the per-brick offsets are added together to produce an <strong>reanchor offset</strong>.</p>
<p>More formally, then, the <strong>anchor column</strong> is the <strong>anchor brick column</strong>, plus the <strong>reanchor offset</strong>. The anchor brick column is the column of a brick on the rune line. Which one will depend on the individual bricks involved, but often it is the first brick on the rune line.</p>
<p>Let <code>r</code> be a rune. <code>r</code> has zero or more <strong>horizontal ancestors</strong>. A rune-ish <code>ia</code> is an horizontal ancestor of <code>r</code> if</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>ia</code> is a brick.</p></li>
<li><p><code>ia</code> is a proper ancestor of <code>r</code>. Here &quot;proper&quot; means the <code>ia</code> and <code>r</code> must be different -- a rune-ish is not its own proper ancestor.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Line(ia) == Line(r)</code>. That is, a rune and its horizontal ancestor must be on the same line.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the number of runechildren required by the brick, and the number of those runechildren joined on the rune line, each brick on the rune line has a <strong>per-brick anchor offset</strong>. If <code>n</code> runechildren of a parent brick are on the rune line, the per-brick anchor offset is the indentation that would apply to the <code>n</code>th runechild, if the <code>n</code>th runechild were split onto the next line. (Note that every horizontal ancestor must have at least one runechild on the rune line -- the child of which it is the ancestor.)</p>
<p>The total of all the per-brick anchor offsets of parent bricks is the <strong>reanchor offset</strong> of the rune line. The <strong>anchor column</strong> of the rune line is the anchor brick column, plus the reanchor offset.</p>
<p>Note that when a rune is the only brick on a line, the above definition of reanchoring is equivalent to the statement that the rune column is the anchor column.</p>
<h3 id="first-example">First example</h3>
<pre><code>        :+  %depends  %|  :~
          definitions+[%&amp; deh]
          listeners+[%&amp; sup]
          waiting+[%&amp; out]
        ==</code></pre>
<p>This is lines 1916-1920 of <code>arvo/sys/vane/ford.hoon</code>. The rune line is line 1916, and the rune is COLSIG (<code>:~</code>). The reanchor base is the COLLUS (<code>:+</code>). COLLUS is 3-fixed, but all three of its runechildren are on the rune line, so the per-brick anchor offset is 0. The anchor column is the anchor brick column plus the reanchor offset, so that in this case, the anchor column is the same as the anchor brick column.</p>
<p>COLSIG is 0-running, and normal COLSIG indentation indents the runsteps one stop past the anchor column, and puts the final TISTIS at the anchor column. This is exactly what we see.</p>
<h3 id="second-example">Second example</h3>
<pre><code>    =/  request-data  :~
        [0 [0 8.080] 0 &#39;localhost&#39; ~]
        ::  associate 0 as the anonymous ship, which is the ++add result.
        [[0 (scot %p (add our ^~((bex 64))))] ~ ~]

    =/  request/silk:ford  [%bake %urb monies [our %home [%da now]] /web]
    (emit `card`[%exec /kiln/prime/cache our `[[our %home [%da now]] request]])</code></pre>
<p>This is lines 346-356 of <code>arvo/lib/hood/kiln.hoon</code>: Here the rune line is line 346, the rune is again COLSIG, and it reanchors at TISFAS (<code>=/</code>). TISFAS is 3-fixed, and 2 of its runechildren are on the rune line, so that the per-brick anchor offset of the TISFAS is that of its 2nd runechild -- one stop. The anchor column is therefore one stop after the anchor brick column.</p>
<p>COLSIG again is 0-running, so that its runsteps should be indented one stop past the anchor column, which in this case means two stops past the anchor brick column. By the same logic, the TISTIS should be indented at the anchor column, whicb is one stop past the anchor brick column. This is what we see in the example. The last three lines of the example are the last runechild of the TISFAS.</p>
<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>
<p>Comments count as whitespace. A comment is a <strong>header comment</strong> if it is on a line by itself. If a comment is not a header comment, it is a <strong>rightside</strong> comment. A rightside comment is a <strong>margin comment</strong> if it begins at or after column 57, or immediately after a horizontal gap of 20 or more spaces. All margin comments should start at column 57. A rightside comment is an <strong>inline comment</strong> if it is not a margin comment.</p>
<h2 id="staircase-comments">Staircase comments</h2>
<p>Informally, staircase comments take the form</p>
<pre><code>::
::
::::
  ::
  ::</code></pre>
<p>More formally, a staircase comment consists of an <strong>upper riser</strong>, a <strong>tread</strong>, and a <strong>lower riser</strong>. The upper riser is a sequence of normal comment lines, aligned at the anchor column. The tread is four colons, aligned at the anchor column and followed by a whitespace character. The lower riser is a sequence of normal comment lines, aligned at the column one stop greater than the anchor column. A more formal definition of a staircase is given in an appendix.</p>
<h2 id="vertical-gaps">Vertical Gaps</h2>
<p>A <strong>vertical gap</strong> is a gap which contains</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A newline-terminated partial line preamble. This preamble may be of length 1 -- that is, it may be just the newline.</p></li>
<li><p>A body of one or more full newline-terminated lines, all of them comments or (in the case of non-standard code) blank lines.</p></li>
<li><p>A partial line postamble. This is never newline-terminated, and may be zero-length.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A vertical gap may contain zero or more <strong>inter-comments</strong> followed by zero or more <strong>pre-comments</strong>. Both inter-comments and pre-comments can contain any content, but in concept, inter-comments separate the sequence steps from other lexemes, and from each other; while pre-comments preceed sequence steps.</p>
<p>The rune-ish expression that directly contains a vertical comment, determines its inter-comment column location and the pre-comment column location. A comment is &quot;directly contained&quot; by a rune-ish if the rune-ish expression contains the comment, but no proper subexpression of the rune-ish expression also contains that comment. This implies taht a comment is &quot;contained&quot; by a rune-ish expression if it separates the rune-ish from the first runechild; of if it separates a consecutive pair of the rune-ish expression's runechildren.</p>
<p>Informally, the body of a standard vertical gap follows these conventions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A vertical gap may contain an &quot;inter-part&quot;, a &quot;pre-part&quot;, or both.</p></li>
<li><p>If both an inter-part and a pre-part are present, the inter-part must precede the pre-part.</p></li>
<li><p>The inter-part is a non-empty sequence of inter-comments and staircases.</p></li>
<li><p>A pre-part is a non-empty sequence of pre-comments.</p></li>
<li><p>Meta-comments may be inserted anywhere in either the pre-part or the inter-part.</p></li>
<li><p>Comments which do not obey the above rules are <strong>bad comments</strong>. A <strong>good comment</strong> is any comment which is not a bad comment.</p></li>
<li><p>A comment is not regarded as a meta-comment if it can be parsed as structural comment. An <strong>structural comment</strong> is any good comment which is not a meta-comment.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A more formal description of a vertical gap body is given in an appendix.</p>
<h1 id="types-of-hoons">Types of hoons</h1>
<p>Every hoon falls into one of 5 disjoint classes: backdented, running, jogging, battery or irregular.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A hoon is a <strong>battery hoon</strong> if it contains an runechild that uses the battery syntax.</p></li>
<li><p>A hoon is a <strong>running hoon</strong> if it contains an runechild that uses the running syntax.</p></li>
<li><p>A hoon is a <strong>jogging hoon</strong> if it contains an runechild that uses the jogging syntax.</p></li>
<li><p>A hoon is a <strong>backdented hoon</strong> if it contains a fixed number of gap-separated runechildren, and none of them follow the running, jogging or battery syntax.</p></li>
<li><p>A hoon is an <strong>irregular hoon</strong> if it is not a backdented, running, jogging or backdented hoon. Most irregular hoons do not contain a gap.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>TODO: Corner cases, including BARCAB. Re BARCAB: ohAitch asks, &quot;Is this not just a battery hoon + single &quot;backdented&quot; same-line child?&quot; Any other tall irregular hoons?</p>
<h1 id="fixed-arity-hoons">Fixed arity hoons</h1>
<p>The flagship Hoon whitespace strategy is backdenting. Variations on the idea of backdenting appear throughout, but the archetypal case of backdenting is its use in fixed arity hoons. Here is a example of a backdented 4-ary hoon:</p>
<pre><code>        :^    %wtcl
            [%dtts [%rock %$ |] [%$ axe]]
          [%rock %f |]
        [%rock %f &amp;]
</code></pre>
<p>A backdented hoon of arity 3 or more should be joined. A backdented hoon of arity 2 or less should be split.</p>
<p>The first runechild of a joined backdented hoon should be on the same line as the rune, separated by a gap. Subsequent runechildren of a joined backdented hoon should be separated by a vertical gap.</p>
<p>The first runechild of a joined backdented hoon should be separated from the rune by a vertical gap. Subsequent runechildren of a joined backdented hoon should also be separated by a vertical gap.</p>
<p>In an fixed <code>n</code>-arity hoon, the <code>m</code>'th runechild should be indented <code>n-m</code> stops more than the anchor column. For example, in an 3-runechild hoon, the first runechild should be indented 2 stops more than the anchor column; a second runechild should be indented 1 stop more than the anchor column; and the third runechild be indented at the anchor column.</p>
<p>This implies that, regardless of the number of runechildren in a backdented hoon,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the last runechild should be aligned at the anchor column;</p></li>
<li><p>every runechild before the last should have a column location one stop greater than the column location of the runechild that follows it.</p></li>
<li><p>every runechild after the first should have a column location one stop less than the runechild that precedes it.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chaining-fixed-arity-hoons">Chaining fixed arity hoons</h2>
<p>As a special case, a runechild of an backdented hoon may have an inter-line alignment, based on its <strong>silo</strong> and <strong>chain</strong>. Here is an example of chained alignment from <code>arvo/sys/zuse.hoon</code>, lines 2950-2959:</p>
<pre><code>     ::
     ::  make acru cores
     ::
     =/  ali      (pit:nu:crub 512 (shaz &#39;Alice&#39;))
     =/  ali-pub  (com:nu:crub pub:ex.ali)
     =/  bob      (pit:nu:crub 512 (shaz &#39;Robert&#39;))
     =/  bob-pub  (com:nu:crub pub:ex.bob)
     ::
     ::  alice signs and encrypts a symmetric key to bob
     ::</code></pre>
<p>If two runchildren are in the same silo of the same chain, they should have the same inter-line alignment.</p>
<p>More formally, a chain is a sequence of fixed-arity hoons which obeys the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Every hoon except the first is the last runchild of the previous hoon in the sequence</p></li>
<li><p>Every rune-ish is either at the same column location as the first hoon in the sequence, or is on the same line as (&quot;joined with&quot;) the rune-ish of previous hoon in the sequence.</p></li>
<li><p>The sequence is maximal. That is, no chain is a sub-sequence of a longer chain.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Silo'ing is by rune-ishes and runechildren of hoons in the chain so that, in the above example, there are 4 rows each of 3 silos. Every row in a chain starts with a rune-ish, but not every rune-ish need start a row, and a given silo may contain both rune-ishes and runechildren. For example, here is code from <code>arvo/sys/hoon.hoon</code>, lines 1572-1575:</p>
<pre><code>    =|  b/(set _?&gt;(?=(^ a) p.n.a))
    |-  ^+  b
    ?~  a   b
    $(a r.a, b $(a l.a, b (~(put in b) p.n.a)))</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, the chain contains 3 rows. (Pedantically, the last line is not a row of the chain.) There are 3 silos, but the rows are &quot;ragged&quot;, so that nothing in the first is in the 3rd silo. In all 3 rows, the 2nd silo is tightly aligned, as is the 3rd silo in the 2nd row.</p>
<p>The 3rd silo of the 3rd row is inter-line aligned. The <code>b</code> in the 3rd row comes after a gap of 3 spaces, but this is standard because it aligns with the <code>b</code> of the 2nd row, at column location 13.</p>
<p>Note that the 2nd silo includes both runechild and a rune-ish. Hoons of a chain may be &quot;joined&quot; on a single line, and this can be convenient when the row starts with a unary rune.</p>
<h1 id="running-hoons">Running hoons</h1>
<p>A running runechild is more often called simply a <strong>running</strong>. (Currently all hoons contains at most one running.)</p>
<p>In addition to the running, a running hoon may contain an runechild before the running. If there is one runechild before the running, it is called the <strong>head</strong> of the running hoon.</p>
<p>There are current three kinds of regular runnings.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A <strong>0-running</strong> has no head. The current 0-running rules are BUCCEN (<code>$%</code>), BUCCOL (<code>$:</code>), BUCWUT (<code>$?</code>), COLSIG (<code>:~</code>), COLTAR (<code>:*</code>), WUTBAR (<code>?|</code>), and WUTPAM (<code>?&amp;</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>A 1-running has a head. The current 1-running rules are CENCOL (<code>%:</code>), DOTKET (<code>.^</code>), SEMCOL (<code>;:</code>), SEMSIG (<code>;~</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>TISSIG (<code>=~</code>) is a special case. TODO: In the code I call this a 0-as-1-running rule. Do I need to say more here?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>[ TODO: More on TISSIG. ]</p>
<h2 id="running-hoons-1">0-running hoons</h2>
<p>0-running hoons may be either split or joined.</p>
<p>This example of a joined 0-running hoon is from <code>arvo/sys/zuse.hoon</code>, lines 2399-2402:</p>
<pre><code>              :~  [b er]
                  [b pk]
                  [(met 0 m) m]
              ==</code></pre>
<p>The running of a joined 0-running hoon should be tightly aligned on the rune line. This implies that the first runestep of every runestep row will be at the same column location as the running.</p>
<p>This example is the beginning and end of a long split 0-running hoon, which starts at line 84 of <code>avro/sur/twitter.hoon</code>.</p>
<pre><code>    :~
      [  {$mentions $~}                %get   /statuses/mentions-timeline  ]

      [  {$rate-limit-info $~}         %get   /application/rate-limit-status  ]
    ==</code></pre>
<p>The column location of the running of a split 0-running hoon should be one stop greater than the rune column. In the vertical gap between the rune and the running of a split 0-running hoon, the inter-comment column location should be the same as the rune column, and the pre-comment location should be the column location of the running.</p>
<p>For both joined and split 0-running hoons, the column location of the TISTIS should be the same as the anchor column location.</p>

<p>The head of a 1-running hoon should occur on the rune line, tightly aligned. The running may either be joined or split. If split, the running should occur one vertical gap after the head, and its column location should be one stop more than the anchor column. If joined, the running should be tightly aligned.</p>
<p>If vertical gap occurs between the head and the running, the inter-comment column is the anchor column, and the pre-column is the column location of the running.</p>

<p>Note that, in the example above, the anchor column is different from the rune column.</p>
<p>The running must be separated from the rune by a vertical gap. The inter-comment location of this vertical gap is the anchor column, and its pre-comment location is undefined. The column location of the running must be the anchor column.</p>
<p>The TISTIS should be at the anchor column. TISSIG is a special case, in that the TISTIS should be aligned with the runsteps. The TISTIS should be separated from the last runstep by a vertical gap, whose inter-comment location is the anchor column, and whose pre-comment location is undefined.</p>
<!-- TODO: TISSIG is very problematic.
By the above definition of correctness, none

<h2 id="runnings">Runnings</h2>
<p>A running is considered to start at the start of its first run step. Every running ends in a TISTIS (<code>==</code>). The TISTIS should occur on its own line, or as part of a criss-cross TISTIS line.</p>
<p>A vertical gap should occur between every pair of runsteps. A vertical gap should also occur between the last runstep and the TISTIS. Inter-comments in a running should be at the anchor column of the parent hoon. Pre-comments in a running should be aligned with the runstep.</p>
<p>A <strong>horizontal sub-running</strong> is a portion of a running which has two or more runsteps on one line. The runsteps in a horizontal subrunning should be tightly aligned, or follow runstep inter-line alignment, as described next.</p>

<h1 id="jogging-hoons">Jogging hoons</h1>
<p>A jogging runechild is more often called simply a <strong>jogging</strong>. (Currently all hoons contains at most one jogging.)</p>
<p>In addition to the jogging, a jogging hoon may contain other runechildren, either before or after the jogging. An runechild after the jogging is called a <strong>tail</strong>. If there is one runechild before the jogging, it is called the <strong>head</strong> of the jogging hoon. If there are two runechildren before the jogging, they are called, in order, the <strong>head</strong> and <strong>subhead</strong> of the jogging.</p>
<p>There are current four kinds of jogging. A 1-jogging has one head and no tail. A 2-jogging has a head and a subhead and no tail. A jogging-1 has a tail and no head.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The current 1-jogging rules are CENTIS (<code>%=</code>), CENCAB (<code>%_</code>) and WUTHEP (<code>?-</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>The current 2-jogging rules are CENTAR (<code>%*</code>) and WUTLUS (<code>?+</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>The current jogging-1 rule is TISCOL (<code>=:</code>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A jogging is a gap-separated sequence of one or more jogs. Every <strong>jog</strong> contains a <strong>jog head</strong>, followed by a gap and a <strong>jog body</strong>. Note that it is important to distinguish between the head of a jogging hoon, defined above, and the head of a jog.</p>
<h2 id="chess-sidedness">Chess-sidedness</h2>
<p>Jogs, joggings and jogging hoons have <strong>chess-sidedness</strong>. Chess-sidedness is always either kingside and queenside.</p>
<p>Informally, <strong>kingside</strong> means the indentation has a left-side bias; and <strong>queenside</strong> means that the indentation has a right-side bias. Indentation will be described more precisely in what follows.</p>
<h2 id="jogs">Jogs</h2>
<p>A jog is <strong>joined</strong> if its head and its body are both on the same line. Otherwise, the jog is said to be <strong>split</strong>.</p>
<p>The indentation of a jog is that of its head. A jog is <strong>joined</strong> if its head is on the same line as its body. Otherwise, a jog is <strong>multiline</strong>. As explained below, a multiline jog may be either <strong>pseudo-joined</strong> or <strong>split</strong>.</p>
<p>A joined jog may be either <strong>aligned</strong> or <strong>ragged</strong>. A joined jog is ragged if its body is indented 1 stop after its head. Otherwise, a joined jog is considered aligned.</p>
<p>All aligned jogs in a jogging should be indented to the same column. This column is called the <strong>jogging body column</strong> of the jogging. A jog body which is aligned at the jog body column is said to be <strong>jogging-body-aligned</strong>. A jog whose jog body is jogging-body-aligned is also said to be <strong>jogging-body-aligned</strong>.</p>
<p>Jogs are either kingside or queenside. The column location of a kingside jog should be 1 stop greater than the base column location of its jogging hoon. The column location of a queenside jog should be 2 stops greater than the base column location of its jogging hoon. The base column location of a jogging hoon was described above, in the description for the different kinds of jogging hoon.</p>
<p>A multi-line kingside jog may either be pseudo-joined or split. A jog is <strong>pseudo-joined</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>if and only every line of it, except the body line, has a comment at the column location where the properly aligned body of a ragged jog would start; or</p></li>
<li><p>if and only every line of it, except the body line, has a comment at the column location where the properly aligned body of a jogging-body-aligned jog would start.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this implies that the line containing the head of the jog must contain a comment. Pseudo-joined jogs are so called because the comment on the line of the head of the jog is a kind of &quot;place holder&quot; for the join, and the comments can be seen as &quot;postponing&quot; the join.</p>
<p>The gap of split jog should be vertical. The inter-comment column location of the gap should be the column location of the jog body; and there should be no pre-comment column location. The column location of the body of a split kingside jog should be 1 stop <strong>greater</strong> than the column location of the jog's head. The column location of the body of a split queenside jog should be 1 stop <strong>less</strong> than the column location of the jog's head.</p>
<h2 id="joggings">Joggings</h2>
<p>A jogging is considered to start at the start of jog head of its first jog. Every jogging ends in a TISTIS (<code>==</code>). The TISTIS should occur on its own line, or a part of a criss-cross TISTIS line.</p>
<p>The TISTIS of a kingside jogging should be outdented one stop from the start of its jogging. The TISTIS of a queenside jogging should be outdented two stops from the start of its jogging.</p>
<h2 id="criss-cross-lines">Criss-cross lines</h2>
<p>Successive TISTIS's may occur on the same line, as part of a <strong>criss-cross TISTIS line</strong>. If a TISTIS is in a criss-cross line, it does not have to be properly aligned, if some other TISTIS with the required alignment &quot;stands in&quot; for it. Such lines are called &quot;criss-cross&quot; because if you drew a line that pairs each TISTIS with the rune that it matches by alignment; and another set of lines, each of which pairs its TISTIS with the rune that it matches syntactically; then the two sets of lines would cross each other.</p>
<p>HEPHEP's may also be joined into criss-cross lines.</p>

<h1 id="battery-hoons">Battery hoons</h1>
<p>The battery hoons are BARCAB, BARCEN and BARKET.</p>
<h2 id="batteries">Batteries</h2>
<p>The cells of a battery should all align at the same column, called the <strong>cell alignment column</strong>. The cells should be separated by vertical gaps, where the base column for header comments is the cell alignment column. The &quot;cell alignment column&quot; is specified below, for each battery hoon.</p>
<h2 id="barcen">BARCEN</h2>
<p>With one exception, the <strong>anchor column</strong> of a BARCEN battery is the column of the first rune on the same line as the rune of the hoon of the battery that contains those cells. The exception is that the rune column of a parent TISGAL or TISGAR rune should never be the anchor column of a BARCEN battery.</p>
<p>Note that BARCEN Cells also should never use the column of a parent LUSLUS, LUSHEP or LUSTIS as their anchor column. Technically, this is not an exception because pedantically, LUSLUS, LUSHEP and LUSTIS are not runes.</p>
<h1 id="selace">SELACE</h1>
<p>Only one-line SELACE's occur in the <code>arvo/</code> corpus. One-line SELACE's are free-form -- <code>hoonlint</code> never generates a warning for them. If <code>hoonlint</code> encounters a multi-line SELACE, it issues a &quot;not yet implemented&quot; warning.</p>
<h1 id="appendix-non-standard-code">Appendix: Non-standard code</h1>
<p>In non-standard code -- code which does not follow these guidelines, <code>hoonlint</code> sometimes must decide the &quot;intended&quot; syntax, in order to produce diagnostics that are as helpful as possible. This section describes the methods used for deciding what was &quot;intended&quot; in non-standard Hoon code.</p>
<h2 id="chess-sidedness-1">Chess-sidedness</h2>
<p>A jog is considered queenside if its indentation is 2 stops or more greater than the anchor column. Otherwise, the jog is considered kingside.</p>
<p>The chess-sidedness of a misindented jogging is that of the majority of its jogs. In case of a tie, the jogging is considered to be queenside. The chess-sidedness of a misindented jogging hoon is that of its jogging.</p>
<h2 id="jogging-body-column">Jogging body column</h2>
<p>In non-standard code, the jogging body column of a jogging is considered to be the most common start column of the bodies of the jogging's aligned jogs. If more than one column is &quot;most common&quot;, so that there is a tie, the jogging body column is the body column of the lexically first jog to have its jog body start at one of the most common columns. If there are no aligned jogs in a jogging, the jogging body column is the body column of the lexically first jog in the jogging.</p>
<h2 id="inter-line-alignment">Inter-line alignment</h2>
<p>In non-standard code, the inter-line alignment of a column of lexemes is the alignment most common in the &quot;wide&quot; lexemes. (Wide lexemes are those which do not have tight or backdented alignment.)</p>
<p>If two alignments tie by wide lexeme count, the tie is broken using the total lexeme count. If two alignments tie by total lexeme count, the tie is broken in favor of the alignment which occurs first, lexically.</p>
<p>If there are no wide lexemes, the inter-line alignment is irrelevant and left undefined. Also, the inter-line alignment is undefined unless it has a total lexeme count of at least 2 -- in other words an inter-line alignment must actually align with a corresponding lexeme on another line.</p>
