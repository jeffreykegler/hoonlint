=head1 NAME

hoonlint - lint utility for the Hoon language

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    hoonlint [options] FILE ...

=head1 Status

This software is alpha -- it should be useable,
but features are evolving
and subject to change without notice.

=head2 Updates

Once MarpaX::Hoonlint leaves alpha,
users should consult Marpa::R2's "updates" page,
which contains notes, errata, etc.,
added since the most recent release.
The "updates" page is C<UPDATES.md> in the
current repo.
At this point, the link is
L<https://github.com/jeffreykegler/hoonlint/blob/master/UPDATES.md>.

=head1 Description

The C<hoonlint> command runs checks on one or more hoon
files.
These may be specified on the command line,
or via the C<-f> option.

=head2 Simple example

The command

    hoonlint hoons/examples/toe.hoon

lint the Tic-tac-toe example for Hoon
(which can be found at
L<https://github.com/jeffreykegler/hoonlint/blob/cf60f1d5eeb8a0270c9d5a80f096e17fabe6a8b8/cpan/hoons/examples/toe.hoon>)
and produces the following output:

    hoons/examples/toe.hoon 58:16 Test::Whitespace wutcol:indent backdented element #2 @58:16; overindented by 1

In this

=over 4

* C<hoon/examples/toe.hoon> is the name of the file.

* C<58:16> is the line number and column of the problem, both 1-based.

* C<Test::Whitespace> is the policy name.

* C<wutcol:indent> is the subpolicy name.

* A human-readable description of the lint issue.
  The rest of the line is describes the lint issue.
  In this case,
  the 2nd runechild of a WUTCOL hoon statement (which is located at line 58, column 16)
  is overindented by 1.

=back

=head2 Example with context

The message of the simple example
becomes a little more understandable, if we ask hoonlint to show the code.
The C<-C 5> option request 5 lines of context, so that the command

    hoonlint -C 5 toe.hoon

produces the following output:

    53              ==                                          ::  53
    54      ++  mo  ^-  {(unit fact) ^game}                     ::  54
    55              ?<  is                                      ::  55
    56              =/  next/side  (~(set bo a.game) here)      ::  56
    57>             ?:  ~(win bo next)                          ::  57
    [ hoons/examples/toe.hoon 58:16 Test::Whitespace wutcol:indent backdented element #2 @58:16; overindented by 1
      anchor column is "?:" @57:13
    ]
    58!                [[~ %win ?:(w.game %x %o)] nu]           ::  58
    59              [~ game(w !w.game, a z.game, z next)]       ::  59
    60      --                                                  ::  60
    61    --                                                    ::  62
    62  --                                                      ::  63

In the above, the original lint message is shown in square brackets, just before the line
(58) to which it refers.
Following the original lint message,
also within the square brackets,
are additional details:

    anchor column is "?:" @57:13

Backdenting is relative to an anchor column, and this detail tells
us where C<hoonlint> thought the anchor column was.

Each line of code is preceded by its line number and an optional tag,
either a zap (C<!>) or a gar (C<< > >>).
A zap indicates a line with a lint issue.
A gar indicates a "topic" line -- a lint which does not actually contain
an issue, but which is relevant to a lint issue.
In this case, line 57 contains the beginning of the hoon statement
which has the backdenting issue.

=head2 Example without details

It is also possible to have context without details.
The command

    hoonlint -C 2 --details=0 fizzbuzz.hoon

runs on Hoon's fizzbuzz example.
It asks for 2 context lines,
with no details.
(The fizzbuzz example can be found at
L<https://github.com/jeffreykegler/hoonlint/blob/cf60f1d5eeb8a0270c9d5a80f096e17fabe6a8b8/cpan/hoons/examples/fizzbuzz.hoon>.)
It produces the following output:

 4  ^-  (list tape)
 5> ?:  =(end count)
[ fizzbuzz.hoon 6:4 Test::Whitespace wutcol:indent backdented element #2 @6:4; overindented by 1 ]
 6!    ~
 7  :-

=head1 Options

=over 4

=item B<-C I<NUM>>, B<--context=I<NUM>>

Display I<NUM> lines of context before and after
the issue message.
If I<NUM> is 0, no context is displayed.
By default, I<NUM> is 0.

=item B<--displayDetails=I<NUM>> B<--details=I<NUM>>

Display I<NUM> levels of detail for the error message.
(Currently at most 1 level of detail is implemented.)
Some issue messages have no details available.
I<NUM> defaults to 1 if more than one line of context
is being displayed.
I<NUM> defaults to 0 is no lines of context are being
displayed.

=item B<-f I<listFile>>, B<--filelist=I<listFile>>

Add the files in the file named I<listFile>
to the files to be processed by C<hoonlint>.
If I<listFile> is C<->, read the list of files
from STDIN.

=item B<-P I<policy>>, B<--policy=I<policy>>

Set the policy that C<hoonlint>
is running to I<policy>.
C<Test::Whitespace> is the default.

Currently,
C<Test::Whitespace> is
the only policy implemented.
It's conventions are documented in L<a separate
document|https://jeffreykegler.github.io/hoonlint/misc/whitespace.html>.

=head1 FAQ

=head2 How do I install hoonlint?

MarpaX::Hoonlint is an ordinary Perl CPAN module,
and installs in the usual ways.
CPAN.org has
L<a page on installing modules|https://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html>,
which contains more than you need to know.
However, since many in hoonlint's intended audience
will be new to Perl, here is
what most newcomers need to know:

=over 4

* First, install Perl.  You need at least Perl 5.10.1.
Almost every UNIX system will come with such a Perl.

* Second, run this command:

    cpan App::cpanminus

* Third, run this command:

    cpanm MarpaX::Hoonlint

=back

That's it.

=head2 How do I install hoonlint from the Git repo?

Do the following:

=over 4

* First, clone the git repo.

* Second, install Perl.  You need at least Perl 5.10.1.
Almost every UNIX system will come with such a Perl.

* Third, download the L<cpanm> command.

    cpan App::cpanminus

* From the directory of the downloaded git repo,
run this command

    cpanm ./cpan

=back

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

C<hoonlint> was made possible by the generous support of
an anonymous member of the Hoon community.
